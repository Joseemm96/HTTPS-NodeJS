Among all the controversies surrounding the 2002 world cup in Korea/Japan, I remember a goal which should’ve been disallowed since the ball was WAY out over the goal line before being passed towards the goal scorer.

I recollected this being in one of South Korea’s two scandalous matches against Italy and Spain, but the footage show no such thing.

Do I have a false memory, or is it another match?
